Okay, I understand. Here's a concise summary of all the features we'll be developing, in the sequence we'll implement them, as outlined in the previous plan. This will be our roadmap, and we'll tackle each one completely before moving to the next:

Feature Summary & Sequence:

Phase 1: Core Editing Functionality (MVP)

Feature 1.1: Basic Text Editor

Summary: Create a basic, functional text editor area. Users can enter, edit, select, copy, cut, paste, and undo/redo text. No syntax highlighting or file handling yet.

Feature 1.2: Basic File Handling

Summary: Implement the ability to open a text file from the local system (or a simulated file system) and display it in the editor. Also implement the ability to save the edited text back to a file (again local or a simulated filesystem)

Feature 1.3: Simple UI

Summary: Develop a minimal user interface containing the editor area and a file menu to open and save files. No toolbars, sidebars, or status bar yet.

Phase 2: Enhanced Editing and UI

Feature 2.1: Syntax Highlighting

Summary: Implement syntax highlighting for Python. The editor will automatically detect the Python file type (.py) or allow the user to specify the type.

Feature 2.2: Line Numbers

Summary: Add line numbers to the left of the code editor, updating the line numbers in realtime as users add or remove lines

Feature 2.3: Basic UI Improvement

Summary: Improve the user interface by introducing a status bar at the bottom of the editor to show language mode and cursor position, and a side bar on the left to display the opened file name

Phase 3: Advanced Editing and Management

Feature 3.1: Advanced Editing

Summary: Implement essential editing features such as search and replace functionality, auto-indentation, and basic auto-completion using a simple dictionary.

Feature 3.2: File Explorer

Summary: Add a file explorer to display a simple file structure. Users will be able to create, delete, and rename files (in a simulated file system if we choose to not use the browser's file system for now)

Feature 3.3: Tabs

Summary: Implement a tabbed view that allows the user to work on multiple files by using tabs.

Phase 4: Further Enhancements and Advanced Features

Feature 4.1: Multi-Language Support

Summary: Add syntax highlighting support for multiple programming languages. Allow users to switch between language modes in the editor.

Feature 4.2: Code Folding

Summary: Implement code folding, allowing users to collapse and expand sections of code.

Feature 4.3: Integrated Settings

Summary: Introduce a settings view to change editor behavior such as themes and auto-indentation.

Feature 4.4: Intelligent Autocompletion

Summary: Implement intelligent auto-completion by using a simple dictionary or integrating a language server (if we add backend support in future)

Feature 4.5: Linting and Error Check

Summary: Add linting and error-checking functionality, displaying errors and warnings in the editor.

Sequential Approach:

We will tackle these features in a sequential manner. We will start with Feature 1.1: Basic Text Editor and make sure that all requirements are met and fully working before moving to Feature 1.2 and so on. This will allow us to have a stable and perfected base for building future functionality.

Ready to Begin?

Now that you have a clear summary of all the features in their implementation sequence, are you ready to move forward with implementing Feature 1.1: Basic Text Editor?
